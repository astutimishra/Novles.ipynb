my name is Astuti Mishra.I am a B.tech student and a web developer intern at the sparks foundation.Thereafter i joined ETG. It gives me a great sense of pleasure to present this project on inventory management (Books management). It includes the basic applications like adding, purchasing, updating the data in a book shop.  Also after purchasing any number of books ,the code will help in generating a customized bill receipt and updating the data.
